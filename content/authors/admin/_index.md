I am a 1st-year graduate student at [REALM Lab](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/realm/) in [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), advised by Prof. [Chuchu Fan](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/chuchu-fan/). My research interests lie in robotics and artificial intelligence. And my goal is to build reliable and intelligent robot!

Prior to joining MIT, I received my Bachelor's Degree from [School of Physics](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io/), Prof. [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/), Dr. [Adam Kortylewski](https://generativevision.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and Prof. [Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/).
